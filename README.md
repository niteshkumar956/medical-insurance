# 🏥 Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

The **Medical Insurance Cost Prediction** project is a machine learning-based system that estimates the cost of medical insurance based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region.

## 🚀 Features
- **Predicts medical insurance costs** based on user inputs.
- Utilizes **linear regression** and other ML models for accurate predictions.
- **Preprocessed dataset** with cleaned and transformed features.
- Interactive **Jupyter Notebook** for easy experimentation.

## 📌 How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleans and transforms the dataset.
   - Encodes categorical variables.
2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Analyzes the impact of different features on insurance cost.
3. **Model Training:**
   - Trains a regression model using the dataset.
   - Evaluates performance using appropriate metrics.
4. **Prediction:**
   - Takes user inputs (age, BMI, smoker status, etc.).
   - Predicts the estimated medical insurance cost.
